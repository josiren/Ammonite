case studies. It highlights innovative applications of these materials in various construction
projects, demonstrating their unique features and benefits.

# Project Stack

This project leverages a modern tech stack designed to enhance performance, maintainability, and
user experience. Below is the breakdown of each technology used in the project:

## Frontend Technologies

### React

- **Purpose**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Usage**: Enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more
  efficient.

### Next.js

- **Purpose**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Usage**: Provides routing, API routes, and optimization features out of the box, enhancing SEO
  and performance.

### Styled-Components

- **Purpose**: A library for writing CSS in JavaScript.
- **Usage**: Allows for component-level styling, making it easier to manage styles in a modular way
  while leveraging the full power of CSS.

### Tailwind CSS

- **Purpose**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **Usage**: Facilitates rapid UI development by providing predefined utility classes that can be
  composed to create complex designs without leaving your HTML.

## Architectural Pattern

### FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)

- **Purpose**: An architectural approach that emphasizes feature-driven development.
- **Usage**: Organizes code into features rather than technical layers, improving scalability and
  maintainability. Each feature contains its own components, styles, and logic, promoting separation
  of concerns.
